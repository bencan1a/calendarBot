# Alexa Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a complete Amazon Alexa integration for CalendarBot Lite that enables voice queries like "What's my next meeting?" and "How long until my next meeting?". The implementation uses a Local LAN + Static Bearer Token approach for minimal complexity while maintaining security.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Server-Side Implementation
- **Modified [`calendarbot_lite/config_loader.py`](calendarbot_lite/config_loader.py)**: Added `alexa_bearer_token` configuration support
- **Modified [`calendarbot_lite/server.py`](calendarbot_lite/server.py)**: Added:
  - Bearer token authentication functions
  - Duration formatting for natural speech
  - Two new Alexa-specific endpoints:
    - `/api/alexa/next-meeting` - Returns next meeting with speech text
    - `/api/alexa/time-until-next` - Returns time until next meeting

### 2. Alexa Skill Backend
- **Created [`alexa_skill_backend.py`](alexa_skill_backend.py)**: Complete AWS Lambda handler that:
  - Handles Alexa skill requests (GetNextMeetingIntent, GetTimeUntilNextMeetingIntent)
  - Calls CalendarBot Lite API with bearer token authentication
  - Formats responses for natural speech
  - Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Testing
- **Created [`tests/test_alexa_integration.py`](tests/test_alexa_integration.py)**: Comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Bearer token authentication (17 test cases)
  - Duration formatting for speech
  - Configuration integration
  - All tests pass ✅

### 4. Documentation
- **Created [`docs/ALEXA_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/ALEXA_INTEGRATION.md)**: Complete technical documentation including:
  - Architecture overview with Mermaid diagram
  - Detailed API contract with request/response schemas
  - Alexa skill interaction model with JSON configuration
  - Security and privacy controls
  - Error handling and troubleshooting

- **Created [`docs/ALEXA_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](docs/ALEXA_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)**: Step-by-step deployment guide covering:
  - CalendarBot Lite configuration
  - HTTPS endpoint setup (Caddy/ngrok options)
  - AWS Lambda deployment
  - Alexa skill creation and configuration
  - Security hardening and maintenance

## Key Features

### API Endpoints
```http
GET /api/alexa/next-meeting
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
Response includes natural language `speech_text` field ready for Alexa.

```http
GET /api/alexa/time-until-next  
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
Response includes human-readable duration formatting.

### Authentication
- Static bearer token stored in config and environment variables
- Simple but secure for single-user home deployment
- No OAuth complexity required

### Natural Speech Formatting
- Smart duration formatting: "in 30 minutes", "in 1 hour and 15 minutes"
- Ready-to-speak responses: "Your next meeting is Team Standup in 30 minutes"
- Handles edge cases: no meetings, past events, etc.

### Privacy & Security
- Calendar data stays on local device
- Only next meeting info exposed to Alexa
- HTTPS required for all communication
- Configurable logging and data retention

## Example Usage

**User**: "Alexa, ask Calendar Bot what's my next meeting?"
**Alexa**: "Your next meeting is Team Standup in 30 minutes."

**User**: "Alexa, ask Calendar Bot how long until my next meeting?"  
**Alexa**: "Your next meeting is in 30 minutes."

## Deployment Options

1. **Local Network + Port Forwarding**: Run CalendarBot locally, forward port, use Caddy for HTTPS
2. **Secure Tunnel (Dev)**: Use ngrok for temporary HTTPS tunnel during development
3. **Cloud Proxy (Advanced)**: Deploy lightweight cloud proxy for professional setup

## Configuration Example

```yaml
# calendarbot_lite/config.yaml
sources:
  - "https://calendar.example.com/calendar.ics"

alexa_bearer_token: "abc123def456..."
server_bind: "0.0.0.0"
server_port: 8080
```

## Architecture

```
Alexa Device → Amazon Alexa Service → AWS Lambda (Skill Backend) 
    → HTTPS Tunnel/Reverse Proxy → CalendarBot Lite Server 
    → In-Memory Event Window
```

## Testing Results

All 17 unit tests pass, covering:
- ✅ Bearer token authentication (valid/invalid/missing/malformed tokens)
- ✅ Duration formatting for speech (seconds/minutes/hours/past events)  
- ✅ Configuration loading with Alexa token
- ✅ ISO datetime serialization
- ✅ Integration patterns

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. Configure CalendarBot Lite with bearer token
2. Set up HTTPS endpoint (Caddy recommended)
3. Deploy Lambda function with skill backend code
4. Create Alexa Custom Skill with provided interaction model
5. Test end-to-end with voice commands

This implementation provides a solid foundation for voice calendar access while maintaining privacy and simplicity for home users.
