## Infrastructure Gaps and Opportunities

### 1. Containerization (Priority: High)

**Current State:**
- Docker configuration documented in [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md)
- No actual Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml in repository
- Manual deployment instructions only

**Recommendation:**
```dockerfile
# Implement production Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["python", "-m", "calendarbot", "--web"]
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent deployment environments
- Simplified scaling and orchestration
- Development-production parity
- Container registry integration

### 2. Cloud Infrastructure Automation (Priority: High)

**Current State:**
- No Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates
- Manual cloud resource provisioning
- No automated deployment pipelines to cloud platforms

**Recommendation:**
```yaml
# Implement Terraform/CloudFormation
- Container orchestration (ECS/GKE/AKS)
- Load balancing and auto-scaling
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Secret management integration
- Blue-green deployment automation
```

### 3. Secret Management (Priority: Medium)

**Current State:**
- Configuration files with placeholder values
- Environment variable reliance
- No external secret management integration

**Recommendation:**
```yaml
# Integrate with cloud secret managers
- AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault / GCP Secret Manager
- Kubernetes secrets for container deployments
- Vault integration for enterprise environments
- Automated secret rotation
```

### 4. Monitoring and Observability (Priority: Medium)

**Current State:**
- Performance benchmarking in CI/CD
- Basic logging configuration
- No distributed tracing or APM integration

**Recommendation:**
```yaml
# Implement comprehensive observability
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Log aggregation (ELK/Fluentd)
- Alert management (PagerDuty/OpsGenie)
```
