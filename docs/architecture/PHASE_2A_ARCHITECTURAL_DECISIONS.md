## 2. Architectural Decision Records

### 2.1 ADR-001: Connection Pool Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: Phase 2A Design  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team  

#### Context

CalendarBot creates new HTTP and database connections for each request, causing:
- 30-50MB memory overhead from repeated connection creation
- 50-150ms latency per request for connection establishment
- Resource exhaustion under concurrent load
- Inefficient resource utilization on Pi Zero 2W

#### Decision

Implement a **dual-layer connection pooling architecture** with:
1. **HTTP Connection Pool**: aiohttp.ClientSession with TCPConnector pooling
2. **Database Connection Pool**: AsyncConnectionPool for SQLite operations
3. **Shared Event Loop Management**: Eliminate per-request event loop creation

#### Rationale

**Why aiohttp.ClientSession over alternatives:**
- **vs. requests**: AsyncIO compatibility essential for non-blocking operations
- **vs. httpx**: aiohttp has more mature connection pooling with better Pi Zero 2W performance
- **vs. urllib3**: aiohttp provides higher-level async interface with built-in pooling

**Why SQLite connection pooling:**
- Pi Zero 2W storage is SQLite-based, not PostgreSQL
- Async connection pooling reduces database lock contention
- Memory-efficient connection reuse for frequent database operations

**Configuration Choices:**
```python
# Conservative sizing for Pi Zero 2W
HTTP_POOL_SIZE = 100        # vs. unlimited: prevents memory exhaustion
HTTP_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST = 30  # vs. 50+: reduces per-host memory pressure
DB_POOL_SIZE = 10           # vs. 20+: balances concurrency vs. memory usage
```

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **No Connection Pooling (Status Quo)**
   - Pro: Simple, no new complexity
   - Con: Continues memory and latency issues
   - **Rejected**: Doesn't address core performance problems

2. **Single Global Connection Pool**
   - Pro: Simpler implementation
   - Con: No per-host connection management, less efficient
   - **Rejected**: Suboptimal for multi-host scenarios

3. **Third-party Pool Libraries (aiopool, etc.)**
   - Pro: Pre-built solutions
   - Con: Additional dependencies, less control over Pi Zero 2W optimization
   - **Rejected**: Custom solution provides better platform optimization

#### Consequences

**Positive:**
- 30-50MB memory reduction from connection reuse
- 50-150ms latency reduction per request
- Better resource utilization under load
- Improved system stability on Pi Zero 2W

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity in connection management
- Potential connection leaks if not properly managed
- Memory usage for pool maintenance (~5-10MB)

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive connection leak detection and cleanup
- Conservative pool sizing with automatic eviction
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 2.2 ADR-002: Request Pipeline Caching Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: Phase 2A Design  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team  

#### Context

CalendarBot processes many repeated requests (status checks, settings retrieval, etc.) without caching, causing:
- Redundant computation for identical requests
- Unnecessary database queries
- Higher CPU usage for repeated operations
- Inefficient resource usage patterns

#### Decision

Implement a **multi-level request pipeline** with:
1. **TTL-based Response Caching**: 5-minute TTL with intelligent cache keys
2. **Request Batching**: Batch similar requests with 50ms timeout
3. **Intelligent Cache Eviction**: Memory-pressure aware eviction strategies
4. **Request Deduplication**: Eliminate duplicate concurrent requests

#### Rationale

**Why TTL Caching over LRU:**
- **Time-based invalidation**: More predictable for dynamic calendar data
- **Memory bounds**: TTL provides natural memory pressure relief
- **Pi Zero 2W optimization**: Prevents unbounded cache growth

**Caching Strategy Decisions:**
```python
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS = 300     # 5-minute balance of freshness vs. efficiency
CACHE_MAX_SIZE = 1000       # Conservative limit for Pi Zero 2W memory
CACHE_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB = 50  # 10% of available optimization memory
```

**Why Request Batching:**
- Reduces individual request processing overhead by ~20-30%
- Optimizes database query patterns
- Improves resource utilization under burst loads

**Batch Configuration:**
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 10             # Conservative batch size for Pi Zero 2W
BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS = 50       # Quick batching to maintain responsiveness
```

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **No Caching (Status Quo)**
   - Pro: Simple, no cache invalidation complexity
   - Con: Continued CPU waste on repeated requests
   - **Rejected**: Misses significant optimization opportunity

2. **Pure LRU Caching**
   - Pro: Simple eviction policy
   - Con: Less predictable memory usage, doesn't handle temporal patterns well
   - **Rejected**: TTL better suits calendar application patterns

3. **Redis External Cache**
   - Pro: Mature caching solution
   - Con: Additional infrastructure, memory overhead, network latency
   - **Rejected**: Too heavy for Pi Zero 2W deployment

4. **Larger Cache Sizes**
   - Pro: Higher hit rates
   - Con: Memory pressure on Pi Zero 2W
   - **Rejected**: Platform memory constraints require conservative sizing

#### Consequences

**Positive:**
- 70%+ cache hit rate for repeated requests
- 100ms average response time improvement for cached responses
- 20% CPU reduction for repeated operations
- Better system responsiveness under load

**Negative:**
- Cache invalidation complexity
- Memory usage for cache storage (~25-50MB)
- Potential stale data if TTL is too long

**Mitigation:**
- Conservative TTL settings with manual invalidation capabilities
- Memory pressure monitoring with automatic cache clearing
- Selective caching for appropriate request types only

### 2.3 ADR-003: Integration Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: Phase 2A Design  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team  

#### Context

Phase 2A optimizations must integrate with existing CalendarBot WebServer without breaking existing functionality or requiring changes to client code.

#### Decision

Implement a **transparent enhancement layer** architecture:
1. **Enhanced WebServer Class**: Extends existing WebServer with optional optimization components
2. **Enhanced Request Handler**: Routes requests through optimization pipeline or legacy handlers
3. **Automatic Fallback**: Graceful degradation to legacy behavior on component failures
4. **Feature Flag Control**: Runtime enable/disable of optimizations

#### Rationale

**Why Enhancement Layer over Replacement:**
- **Risk Mitigation**: Preserves all existing functionality as fallback
- **Incremental Rollout**: Allows gradual activation of optimizations
- **Development Safety**: Reduces chance of introducing regressions

**Integration Approach:**
```python
# Backward-compatible constructor
def __init__(self, settings, display_manager, cache_manager, **kwargs):
    # Existing initialization (unchanged)
    # ... 
    
    # Phase 2A optimization components (new)
    self.connection_manager = None
    self.request_pipeline = None
    self._optimization_enabled = False
    
    # Initialize optimizations if enabled
    self._initialize_optimization_components()
```

**Request Routing Strategy:**
- Optimization-capable requests route through enhanced pipeline
- Non-optimizable requests use existing legacy handlers
- Automatic fallback on optimization component failures
- No changes required to existing API endpoints

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **Complete WebServer Replacement**
   - Pro: Clean slate implementation
   - Con: High risk of breaking existing functionality
   - **Rejected**: Too risky for production deployment

2. **Side-by-side Services**
   - Pro: Complete isolation
   - Con: Complex deployment, service coordination overhead
   - **Rejected**: Overcomplicates architecture for optimization benefits

3. **Middleware-based Integration**
   - Pro: Standard pattern
   - Con: Doesn't integrate well with existing WebServer architecture
   - **Rejected**: Enhancement layer provides better integration

#### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- Safe rollout with automatic fallback capabilities
- Easy enable/disable of optimizations
- Preserved development and operational procedures

**Negative:**
- Additional code complexity in request routing
- Slight performance overhead for request classification
- More complex testing scenarios (optimized vs. legacy paths)

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive integration testing for both optimized and legacy paths
- Clear separation of optimization and legacy code paths
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 2.4 ADR-004: Configuration Management Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: Phase 2A Design  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team  

#### Context

Phase 2A optimizations require sophisticated configuration management for:
- Gradual rollout control across different user populations
- Runtime configuration changes without service restart
- Platform-specific optimization tuning (Pi Zero 2W)
- Emergency disable capabilities

#### Decision

Implement a **hierarchical configuration system** with:
1. **Multi-source Configuration**: Environment variables > Config files > Defaults
2. **Feature Flag Management**: Hash-based consistent rollout with percentage control
3. **Hot Reload**: Automatic configuration reload without service restart
4. **Emergency Controls**: Immediate disable capabilities via API or environment

#### Rationale

**Configuration Hierarchy Design:**
```
Runtime API (highest) → Environment Variables → Config Files → Defaults (lowest)
```

**Why this hierarchy:**
- **Runtime API**: Enables immediate emergency changes without deployment
- **Environment Variables**: Standard containerized deployment pattern
- **Config Files**: Development and testing flexibility
- **Defaults**: Safe fallback values optimized for Pi Zero 2W

**Feature Flag Strategy:**
- **Hash-based rollout**: Consistent user experience (same user always gets same flags)
- **Percentage-based**: Gradual rollout from 0% → 5% → 25% → 75% → 100%
- **Component-level control**: Independent rollout of connection pooling vs. request pipeline

**Hot Reload Justification:**
- Critical for production rollout adjustments
- Avoids service disruption during configuration changes
- Enables rapid response to performance issues

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **Static Configuration Only**
   - Pro: Simple, predictable
   - Con: Requires deployment for configuration changes
   - **Rejected**: Too inflexible for gradual rollout needs

2. **External Configuration Service (Consul, etcd)**
   - Pro: Centralized, feature-rich
   - Con: Additional infrastructure complexity for Pi Zero 2W
   - **Rejected**: Overengineered for single-device deployment

3. **Simple Boolean Flags**
   - Pro: Easy to understand
   - Con: No gradual rollout capability
   - **Rejected**: Doesn't support sophisticated rollout strategies needed

#### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Flexible rollout control with immediate emergency disable
- Platform-specific optimization without code changes
- Hot configuration reload without service interruption
- Sophisticated A/B testing capabilities

**Negative:**
- Configuration complexity increases operational overhead
- Hot reload adds potential for configuration drift
- More complex testing scenarios with different configurations

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive configuration validation with safe defaults
- Configuration change audit logging and rollback capabilities
- Automated configuration testing across different scenarios

### 2.5 ADR-005: Pi Zero 2W Platform Optimization

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: Phase 2A Design  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team  

#### Context

Pi Zero 2W platform constraints require specific optimizations:
- **Memory**: 512MB total RAM with ~362MB available for application optimizations
- **CPU**: Single-core ARM Cortex-A53 at 1GHz
- **Storage**: MicroSD card with limited I/O performance
- **Network**: Single WiFi interface with limited bandwidth

#### Decision

Implement **platform-specific optimization strategies**:
1. **Aggressive Memory Management**: Conservative limits with pressure monitoring
2. **ARM64 Compatibility**: Explicit testing and optimization for ARM architecture
3. **Storage Optimization**: Minimize disk I/O through intelligent caching
4. **Network Efficiency**: Connection pooling to reduce network overhead

#### Rationale

**Memory Budget Allocation:**
```python
# Total optimization memory budget: 200MB (conservative)
CONNECTION_POOL_MEMORY = 100MB     # HTTP + DB connection pools
REQUEST_PIPELINE_MEMORY = 75MB     # Cache + batching
CONFIGURATION_MEMORY = 25MB        # Config + monitoring
```

**Why Conservative Memory Limits:**
- Pi Zero 2W has no swap space for recovery from OOM conditions
- System needs memory headroom for normal operations
- Memory pressure can cause system instability and crashes

**ARM64-Specific Considerations:**
- aiohttp performance characteristics may differ on ARM
- AsyncIO event loop behavior differences
- Third-party library compatibility verification required

**Storage Optimization:**
- Minimize SQLite file I/O through connection pooling
- Cache frequently accessed data in memory
- Avoid temporary file creation

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Optimization (No Platform-Specific)**
   - Pro: Simpler, works everywhere
   - Con: Misses Pi Zero 2W-specific optimization opportunities
   - **Rejected**: Platform constraints require specific optimization

2. **More Aggressive Memory Usage**
   - Pro: Higher performance potential
   - Con: Risk of OOM kills and system instability
   - **Rejected**: Stability more important than maximum performance

3. **Disk-based Caching**
   - Pro: Larger cache capacity
   - Con: Slow MicroSD I/O, wear concerns
   - **Rejected**: Memory-based caching more appropriate for platform

#### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Optimizations specifically tuned for Pi Zero 2W platform
- System stability maintained under optimization load
- Efficient resource utilization within platform constraints
- Better performance than generic optimization approach

**Negative:**
- More complex optimization logic with platform-specific code paths
- Requires Pi Zero 2W hardware for proper testing and validation
- Conservative limits may leave some performance on the table

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive testing on actual Pi Zero 2W hardware
- Platform-specific monitoring and alerting thresholds
- Tuning parameters exposed for optimization adjustment

### 2.6 ADR-006: Error Handling and Resilience Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: Phase 2A Design  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team  

#### Context

Phase 2A optimizations introduce new failure modes that must be handled gracefully:
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Cache memory pressure
- Component initialization failures
- Performance degradation under load

#### Decision

Implement a **defense-in-depth resilience strategy**:
1. **Multiple Fallback Layers**: Optimization → Legacy → Emergency response
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic component disable on failure thresholds
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain core functionality even with optimization failures
4. **Proactive Monitoring**: Early warning systems for potential issues

#### Rationale

**Fallback Architecture:**
```
[Optimized Request Processing]
       ↓ (on failure)
[Legacy Request Processing]
       ↓ (on failure)
[Emergency Response Mode]
```

**Why Multiple Fallback Layers:**
- **Optimization Layer**: Best performance when working
- **Legacy Layer**: Proven stability, identical to pre-Phase 2A behavior
- **Emergency Layer**: Minimal functionality to maintain service availability

**Circuit Breaker Implementation:**
- **Connection Pool**: Disable on >95% utilization or >5 connection failures
- **Request Pipeline**: Disable on memory pressure or >10% cache operation failures
- **Recovery**: Automatic re-enable after configurable recovery period

**Monitoring Strategy:**
- **Proactive**: Alert before failure conditions
- **Reactive**: Immediate response to component failures
- **Predictive**: Trend analysis for capacity planning

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Fallback Layer**
   - Pro: Simpler implementation
   - Con: Less resilient to cascading failures
   - **Rejected**: Insufficient resilience for production deployment

2. **No Automatic Fallback**
   - Pro: Simpler logic, explicit control
   - Con: Requires manual intervention during failures
   - **Rejected**: Not suitable for unattended Pi Zero 2W deployment

3. **Retry-only Strategy**
   - Pro: May resolve transient issues
   - Con: Can amplify problems under load
   - **Rejected**: Fallback provides better reliability

#### Consequences

**Positive:**
- High availability even during optimization component failures
- Automatic recovery from transient issues
- Clear escalation path from optimization to basic functionality
- Reduced operational burden for failure response

**Negative:**
- Complex error handling logic increases code complexity
- Multiple code paths require comprehensive testing
- Potential for unexpected interactions between fallback layers

**Mitigation:**
- Extensive chaos engineering testing of all failure scenarios
- Clear monitoring and alerting for each fallback layer activation
- Regular testing of fallback mechanisms in production environment

## 3. Alternative Architectures Considered

- **Overkill**: Optimization benefits don't justify architectural complexity

### 3.3 Shared Memory Architecture

**Approach**: Use shared memory for cache and connection pool coordination

**Rejected Because**:
- **Platform Limitations**: Limited shared memory facilities on Pi Zero 2W
- **Synchronization**: Complex synchronization required for data consistency
- **Error Handling**: Shared memory corruption is difficult to recover from
- **Implementation Complexity**: Significantly more complex than in-process approach
