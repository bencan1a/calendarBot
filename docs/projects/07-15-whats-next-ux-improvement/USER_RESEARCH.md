# User Research Findings - What's Next View UX Improvement

## Research Summary

**Primary Use Case**: Remote worker meeting flow management  
**Target Environment**: 300x400px greyscale display  
**Core User Need**: "Can I let this conversation continue or do I need to wrap up now?"

## Key Research Findings

### 1. Time Gap Display Requirements

**Finding**: Users need immediate visibility of time gaps between current and next meetings
**User Impact**: Critical for meeting boundary decisions
**Current Gap**: Time relationships not prominently displayed
**Solution Direction**: Prominent time gap visualization with clear boundary indicators

### 2. Smart Meeting Filtering

**Finding**: Users need intelligent filtering of relevant vs irrelevant meetings
**User Impact**: Reduces cognitive load and improves decision speed
**Current Gap**: All meetings shown regardless of relevance
**Solution Direction**: Context-aware filtering based on meeting importance, attendee overlap, and temporal proximity

### 3. Boundary Condition Handling

**Finding**: Edge cases like back-to-back meetings, overlapping events, and end-of-day scenarios require special treatment
**User Impact**: Prevents user confusion during critical decision points
**Current Gap**: Inconsistent handling of scheduling edge cases
**Solution Direction**: Explicit handling and clear visual indicators for boundary conditions

### 4. Visual Hierarchy Optimization

**Finding**: Information must be scannable within 2-3 seconds for effective use
**User Impact**: Enables quick decision-making during active meetings
**Current Gap**: Equal visual weight given to all information elements
**Solution Direction**: Clear visual hierarchy prioritizing actionable information

### 5. Minimal Context Requirements

**Finding**: Users need just enough context to make decisions without overwhelming detail
**User Impact**: Faster processing, reduced cognitive overhead
**Current Gap**: Too much or too little detail in various contexts
**Solution Direction**: Context-adaptive information density

### 6. Glanceability Optimization

**Finding**: Interface must be readable at a glance without requiring focused attention
**User Impact**: Enables use during active meeting participation
**Current Gap**: Layout requires focused reading rather than scanning
**Solution Direction**: Optimized typography, spacing, and information grouping

## Implementation Gaps Identified

### Information Hierarchy Issues
- Equal visual weight for all meeting details
- No clear priority system for displaying information
- Missing emphasis on time-critical elements

### Meeting Filtering Problems
- No distinction between relevant and background meetings
- All events treated with equal importance
- Missing context-aware relevance scoring

### Visual Priority Conflicts
- Competing elements for user attention
- Inconsistent visual language
- Poor contrast and readability on greyscale displays

### Layout Scanning Efficiency
- Information not organized for quick scanning
- Poor grouping of related elements
- Suboptimal use of available screen space

## User Context Analysis

### Physical Environment
- Small display device (300x400px)
- Greyscale output only
- Likely positioned as secondary display
- Used during active meeting participation

### Cognitive Context
- Split attention during meetings
- Need for rapid decision-making
- Minimal time for interface learning
- High cost of errors (meeting management)

### Workflow Integration
- Part of larger meeting management flow
- Used multiple times during single meeting
- Must integrate with existing meeting habits
- Should reduce rather than increase cognitive load

## Research Methodology Notes

Research conducted through systematic analysis of:
- Current "What's Next" view implementation
- User workflow scenarios and decision points
- Technical constraints of target display environment
- Existing UX patterns and best practices

## Next Steps

1. Transform findings into actionable user stories
2. Create technical UX specifications
3. Define implementation priorities and dependencies
4. Establish success metrics for improvement validation
