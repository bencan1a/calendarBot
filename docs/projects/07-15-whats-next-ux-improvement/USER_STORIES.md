## P0 - Critical Stories (Core User Need)

### Story 1: Time Gap Visibility

**Title:** Prominent Time Gap Display

As a remote worker in an active meeting,
I want to immediately see the time gap between my current meeting and the next one,
So that I can quickly decide whether to continue the conversation or start wrapping up.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Time gap is displayed prominently at the top of the view with largest font size
2. Gap duration shows in minutes for gaps under 2 hours, hours for longer gaps
3. Visual indicators differentiate between comfortable gaps (>15min), tight gaps (5-15min), and critical gaps (<5min)
4. When there's no next meeting, display "No more meetings today" or similar clear message
5. Time gap updates automatically as time progresses

**Edge Cases:**
- Current meeting running overtime vs scheduled end
- Next meeting starting early or being cancelled
- Multiple overlapping meetings
- End of business day scenarios

### Story 2: Critical Meeting Boundary Alerts

**Title:** Meeting Boundary Decision Support

As a remote worker managing multiple meetings,
I want clear visual alerts when I'm approaching critical time boundaries,
So that I can make timely decisions about ending conversations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Display changes color/emphasis when gap becomes critical (<5 minutes)
2. Show countdown timer when next meeting is within 10 minutes
3. Display "WRAP UP NOW" or similar urgent message for gaps <2 minutes
4. Include next meeting title and start time for context
5. Handle back-to-back meetings with zero gap appropriately

**Edge Cases:**
- Current meeting ending exactly when next begins
- Next meeting being cancelled during current meeting
- Calendar conflicts and double-bookings
- Meeting time zone differences

## P1 - High Priority Stories (Glanceability)

### Story 3: Optimized Visual Hierarchy

**Title:** Scannable Information Hierarchy

As a remote worker with split attention during meetings,
I want information organized in a clear visual hierarchy that I can scan in 2-3 seconds,
So that I can get the information I need without losing focus on my current meeting.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Most important information (time gap, next meeting) uses largest, boldest text
2. Secondary information (meeting details) uses medium-sized text
3. Least critical information (additional context) uses smallest text
4. High contrast typography optimized for greyscale display
5. Clear visual grouping separates different types of information

**Edge Cases:**
- Very long meeting titles that might overflow
- Missing meeting information (no title, no attendees)
- Multiple meetings starting simultaneously
- All-day events vs timed meetings

---

### Story 4: Greyscale Display Optimization

**Title:** High Contrast Greyscale Layout

As a remote worker using a greyscale display device,
I want the interface optimized for high contrast and readability in greyscale,
So that I can clearly read all information without strain.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All text has sufficient contrast ratio for greyscale displays (minimum 7:1)
2. Important information uses bold weights and larger sizes instead of color
3. Visual separators use line weights and spacing instead of color differentiation
4. Status indicators use typography and iconography instead of color coding
5. Layout maintains readability across different greyscale display technologies

**Edge Cases:**
- Different greyscale display types (e-ink, LCD, etc.)
- Varying ambient lighting conditions
- Display calibration differences
- Text rendering variations

---

### Story 5: Rapid Scanning Layout

**Title:** Quick Scan Information Grouping

As a remote worker who needs to check meeting status frequently,
I want information grouped and positioned for rapid scanning,
So that I can get status updates with minimal visual effort.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Key information positioned in natural reading flow (top to bottom, left to right)
2. Related information visually grouped with consistent spacing
3. Unnecessary visual elements removed to reduce cognitive load
4. Consistent positioning across different meeting scenarios
5. Clear separation between current status and upcoming events

**Edge Cases:**
- Varying amounts of meeting information
- Empty calendar periods
- Weekend vs weekday layouts
- Holiday and time-off scenarios

## P2 - Medium Priority Stories (User Experience)

### Story 6: Smart Meeting Filtering

**Title:** Intelligent Meeting Relevance Filtering

As a remote worker with a busy calendar,
I want to see only meetings that are relevant to my immediate scheduling decisions,
So that I can focus on actionable information without information overload.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Filter out meetings I've declined or marked as "Free" time
2. Prioritize meetings with external attendees over internal team meetings
3. Show maximum of 3 upcoming meetings to avoid overwhelming display
4. Deprioritize all-day events and recurring low-priority meetings
5. Include smart relevance scoring based on attendee overlap and meeting importance

**Edge Cases:**
- Meetings with uncertain attendance status
- Recurring meetings with occasional attendance
- Cancelled meetings that haven't been removed from calendar
- Meetings with missing or incomplete information

---

### Story 7: Context-Adaptive Information Density

**Title:** Appropriate Information Detail Levels

As a remote worker in different meeting contexts,
I want the right amount of detail for each situation without overwhelming information,
So that I can make decisions efficiently with sufficient but not excessive context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Show meeting titles and start times for immediate next meetings
2. Include attendee count for meetings with >3 participants
3. Display location/link only for in-person or non-standard meeting locations
4. Show meeting duration only when significantly different from standard (not 30min/1hr)
5. Adapt detail level based on proximity (more detail for sooner meetings)

**Edge Cases:**
- Meetings with very long titles
- Meetings with many attendees
- Missing meeting details
- Conflicting meeting information

### Story 8: Boundary Condition Handling

**Title:** Edge Case Meeting Scenarios

As a remote worker with complex scheduling needs,
I want clear handling of unusual meeting scenarios and edge cases,
So that I can trust the display to guide my decisions in all situations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Handle overlapping meetings with clear conflict indicators
2. Show appropriate messages for end-of-day scenarios ("No more meetings today")
3. Handle timezone changes and calendar synchronization delays gracefully
4. Display clear status for cancelled or rescheduled meetings
5. Show appropriate information for partial meeting conflicts

**Edge Cases:**
- Meetings spanning midnight
- Calendar sync failures or delays
- Meeting invitation responses pending
- Recurring meeting exceptions
- Multiple calendar sources with conflicts

### Story 9: Performance Optimization

**Title:** Fast Load and Refresh Performance

As a remote worker using a secondary display device,
I want the What's Next view to load and refresh quickly,
So that I get timely information without delays that might affect my meeting decisions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Initial view loads in under 2 seconds
2. Updates reflect calendar changes within 30 seconds
3. Minimal bandwidth usage for devices with limited connectivity
4. Efficient rendering optimized for target display resolution (300x400px)
5. Graceful degradation when calendar services are slow or unavailable

**Edge Cases:**
- Poor network connectivity
- Calendar service outages
- Large calendar datasets
- Multiple calendar integrations

### Story 10: Error Handling and Resilience

**Title:** Robust Error Handling

As a remote worker depending on schedule information,
I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide useful fallback information,
So that I can still make informed decisions even when there are technical issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Display clear error messages when calendar data is unavailable
2. Show last known good information with timestamp when updates fail
3. Provide manual refresh option when automatic updates aren't working
4. Handle authentication expiration gracefully with clear user guidance
5. Log errors appropriately for debugging without exposing sensitive information

**Edge Cases:**
- Complete calendar service outages
- Authentication token expiration
- Network connectivity loss
- Malformed calendar data
- Rate limiting from calendar services
