## User Stories

### Epic 1: Settings Panel Foundation

#### Story 1.1: Gesture-Based Settings Access

**Title:** Kindle-Style Settings Access

As a technical user,
I want to access settings through a top-drag gesture interface,
So that I can configure CalendarBot without disrupting my calendar view workflow.

So that I can optimize readability for my display and viewing distance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Separate font size controls for headers, body text, time labels
2. Relative sizing options (small, medium, large, extra-large)
3. Live preview of font changes
4. Minimum/maximum size constraints to prevent unusable interfaces
5. Reset to defaults option
6. Per-layout font size settings

**Edge Cases:**
- Font sizes that break layout constraints
