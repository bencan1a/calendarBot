# CalendarBot Package Restructuring

This project aims to unify the calendarbot and calendarbot_epaper packages into a single, simplified package structure that follows Python best practices.

## Objectives

1. Eliminate the unnecessary complexity of having two separate packages
2. Create a logical directory structure that maintains clear separation of concerns
3. Design a clean dependency management strategy for optional e-Paper hardware
4. Simplify the import and integration strategy to eliminate complex fallbacks
5. Ensure all functionality is preserved while improving maintainability

## Current Status

This project is in the design phase. The implementation plan will be developed here.
