# Phase 5: Testing

## Objectives
- Validate the complete implementation
- Ensure stability and reliability
- Identify and fix issues
- Document performance characteristics

## Requirements
- Complete implementation from previous phases
- Testing environment
- Test cases and scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

## Implementation Tasks
- Develop comprehensive test suite
- Create automated tests for core functionality
- Design stress tests for stability validation
- Implement long-running tests for reliability
- Develop performance measurement tools
- Document testing procedures

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for system functionality
- Stress tests for stability
- Long-running tests for reliability
- Performance tests for optimization validation
- User acceptance testing

## Success Criteria
- All test cases pass
- Implementation is stable under stress
- System remains reliable during long-running tests
- Performance meets or exceeds targets
- No critical issues remain unresolved
- Documentation is complete and accurate
