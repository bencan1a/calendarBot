# Phase 2: Display Driver Development

## Objectives
- Develop e-Paper display driver
- Implement basic rendering functionality
- Establish communication protocol

## Requirements
- Python driver for Waveshare 4.2inch e-Paper Module (B) v2
- Compatibility with Raspberry Pi OS
- SPI interface configuration

## Implementation Tasks
- Research existing Waveshare e-Paper drivers
- Adapt driver for CalendarBot requirements
- Implement basic rendering functions
- Create abstraction layer for display operations
- Develop color mapping functionality (RGB to Black/White/Red)

## Testing Requirements
- Test driver initialization
- Verify SPI communication
- Test basic rendering operations
- Validate color mapping accuracy
- Measure refresh performance

## Success Criteria
- Driver successfully initializes and controls display
- Basic rendering operations work correctly
- Color mapping functions accurately
