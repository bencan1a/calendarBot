# Testing Strategies

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategies for the e-Paper display integration project. It provides a comprehensive approach to ensure the reliability, performance, and stability of the implementation.

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing

- **Driver Layer Testing**
  - Test SPI communication functions
  - Validate buffer management
  - Test color mapping functions
  - Verify command sequences

- **Renderer Testing**
  - Test rendering algorithms
  - Validate color conversion
  - Test partial update logic
  - Verify text rendering

- **Integration Testing**
  - Test driver and renderer interaction
  - Validate data flow through layers
  - Test error handling and recovery
  - Verify configuration management

### Hardware Testing

- **Display Functionality**
  - Test initialization sequence
  - Validate full refresh operations
  - Test partial refresh operations
  - Verify color accuracy

- **Performance Testing**
  - Measure refresh rates
  - Evaluate power consumption
  - Test under different environmental conditions
  - Benchmark rendering operations

### Stability Testing

- **Long-running Tests**
  - Continuous operation testing
  - Multiple refresh cycle testing
  - Power cycle recovery
  - Error recovery testing

- **Edge Case Testing**
  - Test with boundary conditions
  - Validate error handling
  - Test with corrupted data
  - Test with resource constraints

## Test Plans

### Automated Testing

- Develop pytest-based test suite for software components
- Create automated hardware test scripts
- Implement CI/CD pipeline integration
- Develop performance benchmarking tools

### Manual Testing

- Visual inspection of display output
- User experience evaluation
- Hardware integration verification
- Environmental condition testing

## Success Criteria

- All unit tests pass
- Integration tests validate system functionality
- Hardware tests confirm display operation
- Performance meets target metrics
- Stability tests show reliable operation
- No critical issues remain unresolved

*Note: Detailed test plans and test cases will be developed as the project progresses.*
