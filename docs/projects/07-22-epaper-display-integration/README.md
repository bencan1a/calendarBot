# E-Paper Display Integration for whats-next-view

## Overview
This project focuses on porting the existing whats-next-view (300x400 pixels) to render on a Waveshare 4.2inch e-Paper Module (B) v2 connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.

## Hardware Target
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- Waveshare 4.2inch e-Paper Module (B) v2

## Key Challenges
- Pixel-perfect compatibility between web view and e-ink display
- Adapting to e-ink display characteristics (refresh rate, contrast)
- Color mapping from web colors to e-ink's black/white/red palette
- Handling refresh limitations of e-ink technology
- Power optimization for Raspberry Pi Zero 2W

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Hardware Setup
Setting up the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with the Waveshare e-Paper Module and establishing basic communication.

### Phase 2: Display Driver Development
Developing and implementing the driver for the e-Paper display to enable rendering capabilities.

### Phase 3: View Adaptation
Adapting the existing whats-next-view to work with the e-Paper display, including layout and color adjustments.

### Phase 4: Optimization
Optimizing the rendering performance and refresh handling for the e-Paper display.

### Phase 5: Testing
Comprehensive testing of the implementation to ensure stability and reliability.
