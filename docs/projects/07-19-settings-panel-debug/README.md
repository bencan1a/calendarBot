# Settings Panel Debug Investigation

**Project**: CalendarBot Settings Panel Debug  
**Date**: 2025-07-19  
**Mode**: Project Research â†’ Architect  

## Investigation Scope

The settings panel in calendarbot's whats-next-view is non-functional. Users should be able to:
1. Tap/click the top edge of the screen to reveal a drag handle
2. Perform a downward drag or click gesture to overlay the settings panel

Currently, no response occurs when interacting with the top screen area.

## Key Files Under Investigation

### Core Implementation Files
- `calendarbot/web/static/layouts/whats-next-view/whats-next-view.js`
- `calendarbot/web/static/layouts/whats-next-view/whats-next-view.css`
- `calendarbot/web/static/shared/js/settings-panel.js` 
- `calendarbot/web/static/shared/css/settings-panel.css`
- `calendarbot/web/static/shared/js/gesture-handler.js`
- `calendarbot/web/static/shared/js/settings-api.js`

## Investigation Areas

1. **Touch Event Handler Registration and Flow**
2. **Gesture Recognition Implementation** 
3. **Drag Handle Creation and Visibility Logic**
4. **Panel Animation States and CSS Transforms**
5. **Event Propagation and Coordination Between Components**

## Expected Deliverables

- `CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive analysis of existing architecture
- Identification of potential failure points in the interaction pipeline
- Recommendations for systematic debugging approach
