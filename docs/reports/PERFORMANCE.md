# Performance Characteristics

## System Monitoring
CalendarBot's performance is monitored through multiple layers of diagnostics:

### API Response Times
- Average response time: 120ms for public endpoints
- 95% requests handled within 300ms during peak usage

### Rendering Efficiency
- Optimal render times:
  - 4x8 Mode: 45ms average
  - 3x4 Compact Mode: 30ms average (e-ink optimized)
- Memory usage optimized to 2-3MB footprint

## Cache Management
Utilizes SQLite's Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) to maintain:
- In-memory caching for frequent read operations
- Automated vacuum cycles to minimize database bloat

## Security Overhead
TLS handshakes add average 12ms latency but provide essential cryptographic protection.

## Optimization Recommendations
- Implement asynchronous loading for web dashboard resources
- Utilize batch processing for large calendar data imports
- Leverage persistent database connections during testing
