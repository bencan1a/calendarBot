# Legacy Packaging File Removal - Phase 4

## Date: 2025-07-08

## Files Removed:
- `setup.py` (181 lines) - Moved to backup directory

## Rationale:
The legacy `setup.py` file has been superseded by the modern `pyproject.toml` packaging standard. After analysis and testing, `setup.py` was determined to be redundant because:

### pyproject.toml Completeness Verification:
✅ **Project metadata**: Complete (name, version, description, authors, etc.)
✅ **Dependencies**: All runtime dependencies properly specified
✅ **Optional dependencies**: dev, rpi, and test groups configured
✅ **Entry points**: Console script `calendarbot = calendarbot.__main__:main` correctly defined
✅ **Build system**: Modern setuptools configuration with setuptools-scm
✅ **Tool configurations**: Black, isort, mypy, pytest, coverage configurations included

### setup.py Unique Features Analysis:
- **Post-install setup**: Created user config directories (`~/.config/calendarbot`, etc.)
  - **Status**: REDUNDANT - Application already handles directory creation dynamically in multiple places:
    - `main.py` line 30, 88, 125, 159
    - `calendarbot/setup_wizard.py` line 642
    - `calendarbot/main.py` line 375
    - `config/settings.py` line 208
- **Custom install commands**: `PostInstallCommand` and `PostDevelopCommand`
  - **Status**: REDUNDANT - Directory creation handled by application runtime
- **Data files**: Documentation and example config installation
  - **Status**: PRESERVED - Maintained in `pyproject.toml` via package-data configuration

### Build System Verification:
✅ **Package builds successfully**: `python -m build --wheel` completed without errors
✅ **Entry points work**: Console script correctly accessible
✅ **Dependencies properly resolved**: All package data and static files included
✅ **Modern packaging standards**: Uses setuptools>=61.0 with pyproject.toml backend

## Testing Performed:
1. Built wheel package using only `pyproject.toml`
2. Verified entry points in built wheel
3. Confirmed package structure and data files inclusion
4. Tested entry point accessibility

## Safety Measures:
- Original `setup.py` preserved in backup directory
- Build system tested thoroughly before removal
- All functionality confirmed to work with `pyproject.toml` only

## Impact:
- ✅ Reduced packaging complexity
- ✅ Eliminated redundant configuration
- ✅ Modern Python packaging standards compliance
- ✅ No functional impact - all features preserved

## Recovery Instructions:
If `setup.py` functionality is needed for any reason, the original file is preserved in this backup directory and can be restored.
