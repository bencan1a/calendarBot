### Resource Constraint Targets

**Pi Zero 2W (512MB RAM) Optimization Sequence:**
1. Debug utilities removal (immediate 30% bundle reduction)
2. Performance monitoring disable (10-20MB savings)
3. Cache system simplification (20-50MB savings)
4. Browser memory thresholds (aggressive 64MB limit)

**Minimal Deployment Configuration:**
- Total potential reduction: ~3500+ lines of code
- Memory savings: 100-200MB in constrained environments
- Performance improvement: 15-30% in resource-limited scenarios

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1 (Quick Wins - 1-2 weeks):**
- Configure build system for debug utility exclusion
- Remove deprecated functionality and legacy code
- Implement feature flags for performance monitoring

**Phase 2 (Strategic Targets - 3-4 weeks):**
- Optimize static asset serving with caching layer
- Simplify caching system by removing dual storage
- Consolidate event models and eliminate duplication

**Phase 3 (Architectural Changes - 6-8 weeks):**
- Reduce abstraction layer overhead
- Implement deployment mode configurations
- Create minimal/standard/full build variants
