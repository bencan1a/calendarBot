# Whats-Next-View Layout Project

## Overview

This project contains the development documentation and implementation tracking for the "whats-next-view" layout for CalendarBot. This layout is designed to provide users with an intuitive, forward-looking view of their upcoming calendar events and commitments.

## Project Structure

```
whats-next-project/
├── README.md                   # This file - project overview and structure
├── RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md         # Key findings from research phase
├── DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md          # Progress tracking through development stages
├── ARCHITECTURE.md             # Design decisions and technical specifications
└── templates/                  # Documentation templates for development phases
    ├── PHASE_TEMPLATE.md       # Template for documenting each development phase
    └── REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md      # Template for chained review documentation
```

## Actual Layout Implementation

The actual layout files are implemented in the CalendarBot codebase at:
```
calendarbot/web/static/layouts/whats-next-view/
├── layout.json                 # Layout configuration and metadata
├── whats-next-view.css         # Styling for the layout
└── whats-next-view.js          # JavaScript functionality (optional)
```

## Project Goals

1. **Create a forward-looking calendar layout** that helps users understand their upcoming commitments
2. **Follow CalendarBot's established patterns** for layout development and integration
3. **Implement comprehensive documentation** at each development stage
4. **Ensure proper testing and validation** before deployment
5. **Maintain compatibility** with existing CalendarBot infrastructure

## Development Phases

1. **Setup & Documentation Framework** ✅ (Current Phase)
   - Project structure creation
   - Documentation framework establishment
   - Research findings compilation

2. **Layout Configuration Design** (Next Phase)
   - layout.json schema definition
   - Capability and resource specifications
   - Theme and display parameter configuration

3. **Frontend Implementation** (Upcoming)
   - CSS styling implementation
   - JavaScript functionality (if needed)
   - Responsive design considerations

4. **Integration & Testing** (Future)
   - CalendarBot integration testing
   - Layout discovery verification
   - User acceptance testing

5. **Documentation & Deployment** (Final)
   - Complete documentation review
   - Deployment preparation
   - User documentation creation

## Key Technical Requirements

- **Auto-discovery**: Layout must be automatically discovered by LayoutRegistry
- **Configuration Schema**: Must follow CalendarBot's layout.json schema
- **Resource Management**: Proper integration with CalendarBot's resource system
- **Theme Support**: Compatible with existing theme infrastructure
- **Responsive Design**: Support for various display sizes and devices

## Getting Started

1. Review the `RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md` for background context
2. Check `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` for current progress
3. Refer to `ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical specifications
4. Follow the development phases in sequence

## Documentation Standards

This project uses a chained review system where each development phase is thoroughly documented before proceeding to the next. All documentation follows CalendarBot's established patterns and maintains consistency with the existing codebase.
